      <h1>Drawing/Painting Types</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        There are various types of drawing and painting, each with its own
        unique characteristics. Each type offers artists different ways to
        express themselves creatively.
      </p>

      <h2>For Example, These Are Different Types:</h2>

      <h2 style="color: #6da9c5">Oil Painting</h2>
      <p>
        Oil painting involves using pigments mixed with a drying oil, usually
        linseed oil. It offers rich colors, depth, and texture. Oil paints have
        a slow drying time, allowing for blending and layering techniques.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #6da9c5">Acrylic Painting</h2>
      <p>
        Acrylic paints are water-based and dry quickly. They can be used on
        various surfaces and allow for versatility in techniques, from thin
        washes to thick impasto textures.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #6da9c5">Pastel Drawing</h2>
      <p>
        Pastel drawing utilizes soft or oil pastels to create vibrant, textured
        artwork with a wide range of colors and blending capabilities.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #6da9c5">Ink Drawing</h2>
      <p>
        Ink drawing involves using ink, pens, brushes, or markers to create
        artwork with bold lines, intricate details, and a wide range of
        textures.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #6da9c5">Landscape</h2>
      <p>
        Landscape art focuses on depicting natural scenery, ranging from
        realistic portrayals to more stylized or abstract interpretations.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #6da9c5">Portrait</h2>
      <p>
        Portrait art captures the likeness and personality of individuals,
        ranging from traditional, lifelike representations to more experimental
        or interpretive styles.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #6da9c5">Realism</h2>
      <p>
        Realism aims to depict subjects as they appear in everyday life, often
        with a high level of detail and accuracy. It can range from
        photorealistic paintings to more subdued and understated representations
        of reality.
      </p>

      <p>There are more types, but these are just examples.</p>
